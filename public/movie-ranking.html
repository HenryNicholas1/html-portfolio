<p>This action packed movie will leave you feeling estatic. Here is a short summary about this movie <br />

When sadistic mobster Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) and his thugs steal John's prized car and kill the puppy that was a last gift from his wife, John unleashes the remorseless killing machine within and seeks vengeance.
